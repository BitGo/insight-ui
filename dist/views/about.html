        <h3 class="m24t">THE RMG BLOCKCHAIN IS DESIGNED FOR SAFETY FROM THE GROUND UP:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li class="m18t">
            All wallets are multi-signature. Security experts have long recognized the value of multi-signature wallets. Single-key losses are not possible on the RMG blockchain.
          </li>
          <li class="m18t">
            No “black holes”.  Due to the way the blockchain enforces keys, it is impossible to send funds to an invalid address where the RMG could not be recovered.
          </li>
          <li class="m18t">
            All parties participating on the network are identified before being allowed to transact.
          </li>
          <li class="m18t">
            The blockchain exclusively utilizes trusted, proven technology.  It does not contain smart contracts, experimental cryptographic functions, or algorithms that have not already been heavily tested and proven in existing blockchain systems.
          </li>
