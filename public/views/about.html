        <h3 class="m24t">THE RMG BLOCKCHAIN IS DESIGNED FOR SAFETY FROM THE GROUND UP:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li class="m18t">
            The RMG network will require multiple, independent cryptographic signatures to enact any transaction thereby keeping RMG safe from loss of a single-key. Due to the way the blockchain enforces the addresses, it is not possible to send RMG to an invalid destination where the RMG could not be recovered.
          </li>
          <li class="m18t">
            The Asset Trading Platform is secured by industry cyber-security practices and controls, which are informed by global frameworks such as NIST and ISO.
          </li>
          <li class="m18t">
            All parties participating on the network are identified.
